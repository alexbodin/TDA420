# Prototype for a concept design in the course TDA420

This app was a medium-fidelity prototype to get the feel for a design idéa with a really quick development.
The prototype is a semi-functional skeleton to try to capture the main interaction with the app, and focuses on the human-computer interaction design, not the functionality.

The concept of the app is to create a smart bike lock with gps and alarm to protect the bike, the idéa is for the alarm to sound if the bike is moved while locked or if the chain is tempered with. And for the user to locate the bike if stolen or if you forget where it was parked.
