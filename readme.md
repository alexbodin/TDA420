# Prototype for a concept design in the course TDA420

This is a quick and dirty prototype for a concept design.
The prototype is a semi-functional medium-fidelity prototype to try to test the design and interaction with the app, and focuses on the human-computer interaction design, not the functionality.

The concept of the app is to create a smart bike lock with gps and alarm to protect the bike, the id√©a is for the alarm to sound if the bike is moved while locked or if the chain is tempered with. And for the user to locate the bike if stolen or if you forget where it was parked.
